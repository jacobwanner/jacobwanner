- 👋 Hi, I’m @jacobwanner

- 👀 I’m interested in growing my knowledge in all areas of life but especially coding!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript but also more about git and the command line interface.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project you might have in mind! I am a hardworker who doesnt like to stop until I have my project perfect.
